1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    when I'm doing collaborative work

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	to control the workflow so there might not be a conflict
	
3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	clones are a copies from remote to local, forks are copies from remote to remote and branches contain a different version or files from the same repository

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	being able to see the differences between branches and resolve any possible merge conflict 
	
5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	I would collaborate by having multiple copies of the same project each one with the changes from each collaborater specifying which lines they changed.
	I don't find what could be easier but what would be harder might be everything!

1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    when I'm doing collaborative work

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	to control the workflow so there might not be a conflict
	
3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	clones are a copies from remote to local, forks are copies from remote to remote and branches contain a different version or files from the same repository
